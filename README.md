## User Study Time!
![user_study](assets/user_study.jpg)
Which one do you think is better? Some images are generated by Pixart-Î± (50 NFE). Some images are generated by  **TDM (4 NFE)**, distilling from Pixart-Î± in a data-free way with merely 500 training iterations and 2 A800 hours.

## Fast Text-to-Video Geneartion

Our proposed TDM can be easily extended to text-to-video.

The video on the left was generated by CogVideoX-2B (100 NFE). In the same amount of time, **TDM (4NFE)** can generate 25 videos, as shown on the right, achieving an impressive **25 times speedup  without performance degradation**. (Note: The noise in the GIF is due to compression.)

## Pre-trained Models
The pre-trained models include TDM-dreamshaper-LoRA, TDM-SD3-LoRA, TDM-CogVideoX-1.5B-LoRA, which are released in our [huggingface repo](https://huggingface.co/Luo-Yihong/TDM). Please check it!


## ðŸ”¥TODO 
- Pre-trained Models will be released soon.
